# Server Decommissioning Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an integrated approach to server lifecycle management using Python for data manipulation and analysis, SQL for data storage, Power BI for data visualization, and AWS for cloud infrastructure management.
It aims to provide a comprehensive toolset for predicting the decommissioning of servers based on historical data, thereby optimizing resource utilization and cost.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Leverage Python to perform data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Utilize SQL databases to store and manage structured data efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Implement Power BI dashboards for insightful visual representations of the data.
- **Cloud Integration**: Use AWS services for hosting the database and potentially running the Power BI service.

## System Architecture
The project integrates multiple technologies to create a robust server decommissioning analysis system:
- **Python**: Scripting for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **SQL Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS for data persistence.
- **Power BI**: Dashboards and reports for data visualization.
- **AWS Services**: RDS for database hosting, S3 for data storage, and EC2 for running analytics processes if necessary.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the necessary environment and tools for running the project.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI Desktop
- AWS Account

### Local Setup
1. **Python Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Database Setup**:

Install PostgreSQL locally or set up a PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS.
Configure your database settings in config.py.

3. **Power BI Setup**:

Install Power BI Desktop.
Connect Power BI to the PostgreSQL database using the provided connection string in Power BI.

### AWS Configuration
AWS RDS:
Create a new RDS instance for PostgreSQL.
Ensure proper security group configurations to allow access from your IP and Power BI services.
AWS S3:
Set up an S3 bucket for storing backups or additional datasets if needed.

Usage
Running the Python Scripts:

cd scripts
python analysis.py

**Launching Power BI Reports:**
Open the .pbix file with Power BI Desktop.
Refresh the data model to load the latest data from the SQL database.
